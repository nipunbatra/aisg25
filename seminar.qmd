### **Abstract**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is enhancing clinical decision-making using multimodal data. However, its application has largely been limited to imaging data. In this talk, I will showcase AI’s potential in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and high-risk Intensive Care settings. I will discuss barriers such as explainability and evaluation, proposing pathways for AI-enhanced health systems addressing global infectious diseases.

### **Abstract**
The global food system faces unprecedented challenges. In 2023, 2.4 billion people experienced moderate to severe food insecurity due to climate change and shifting diets. Agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating a shift toward sustainable practices.

📈 To feed a projected 9.6 billion people by 2050, the FAO estimates a 60% increase in food production. Machine learning can drive this transformation through digitization, precision monitoring, and data-driven decisions.

### **Biosketch**
Alok is a software engineer at Google DeepMind leading AnthroKrishi, a team focused on remote sensing and AI-driven agriculture solutions.
