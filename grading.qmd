| SNo | Category                                  | Marks |
|---- |------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1   | **Presentation Quality** (spoken and slides) | 3     |
| 2   | **Q&A**                                  | 1     |
| 3   | **Discussion: Reasons to Accept**       | 2     |
| 4   | **Discussion: Reasons to Reject**       | 2     |
| 5   | **Explaining Approach**                 | 2     |
| **Total** | **—**                             | **10** |

Each presenter is expected to clearly articulate the paper’s key ideas, defend their interpretation during Q&A, and contribute to discussions on whether the paper should be accepted or rejected.
